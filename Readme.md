# Happy Twitter: An Interactive Visualization

As an avid twitter user (A fancy way of saying that I am always on twitter) it is easy to get overwhelmed by the constant stream of negative news and toxicity so I created a simple Shiny app that tells you what people are happy about on Twitter, who they are and why they are happy. Hopefully you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed created this! :)
